                <p>
                    Wrathful Hedgehog was our first game project at FutureGames.
                    <br><br>
                    The game was built with C# and Unity together with a team of 14 people assigned by FutureGames.

            <h1 class="game-sub-title">Introduction</h1> <!-- Introduction -->
            <p>
                In this project I took the responsibility of programming the game's <mark>gameplay</mark> and <mark>artificial intelligence</mark> since that was our second 
                core mechanic of the game. We use <mark>Perforce</mark> desktop as source control, <mark>Miro</mark> for prototyping, <mark>Jira</mark> for project management. 
                I mainly put lot of focus on AI but I also worked making the cave shrink, health, and <mark>UI</mark>. 
                I also wanted to get a better understanding of unity AI since it was my first time using it.
            </p>

                <p>
                    Health and <mark>UI</mark> was basic, whenever the player was taking damage I had a collider function on the enemie when they were in attacking 
                    state and collided with the player. 
                    <br><br>
                    The <mark>game manager</mark> was used for knowing when the round was over. there were 2 turns, one for the when the enemies were spawning in and the cave shrinking
                    and one for where the player could get ready for the next wave after defeating all the enemies in the previous round.

            <div class="game-grid-container">
                <p>
                    This was my first time doing any artificial intelligence, therefore nothing too complicated was made in this project. 
                    <br><br>
                    I installed Unity's AI Navigation to utilize a <mark>NavMesh</mark> for ground surface navigation and a <mark>NavMesheshAgent</mark> for enemy 
                    pathfinding, enabling them to navigate around obstacles.
                    <br><br>
                    I also implemented the enemy spawner, which communicates with the game manager to determine when and how many enemies to spawn. 
                    The enemy script handles their individual behaviors, including health management, movement, attacking, and targeting the player.

            <h1 class="game-sub-title">What I learned</h1> <!-- What I Learned -->
            <p>
                Working on this project with someone other than myself taught me a lot. I learned that it is important to not assume things, 
                even if it seems obvious to you. After the project we also did code reviews, which was 
                really edducational for me to see another persons coding style when it comes to game development.
