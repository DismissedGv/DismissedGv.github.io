                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Wrathful Hedgehog was our first game project at FutureGames and it was made with C#/Unity together with a team assigned by FutureGames.
                    <br> <br>
                    It's a game about deleting the devevelopers of the game and as you delete the crew, you also delete the game which is the end goal. <br><br>

        <div class="game-introduction">
            <h1 class="game-sub-title">Introduction</h1>
            <p>In this project I took the responsibility of programming the game's <mark>artificial intelligence</mark> since that was our second core mechanic of the game. 
                We use <mark>github</mark> desktop as source control, <mark>miro</mark> for prototyping, <mark>jira</mark> for project management. I mainly put lot of focus 
                on AI but I also worked making the map shrink, health, and UI. I also wanted to get a better understanding of unity AI since it was my first time using it.</p>

            <h1 class="game-sub-title">Artificial Intelligence</h1>
            <p>This was my first time doing artificial intelligence in anything, therefore nothing too complicated was made here. I downloaded Unitys AI Navigation to 
                be able to use a Navmesh for the ground surface and nav mesh agent so the enemies know where to walk and avoid obstacles.
            </p>

            <h1 class="game-sub-title">What I learned</h1>
            <p>Working on this project with someone other than myself taught me a lot. I learned that it is important to not assume things, 
                even if it seems obvious to you. We all work differently. After the project we also did code reviews. This was 
                edducational for me to see another persons coding style when it comes to game development.</p>
