                <p>Delete The Devs is a game about deleting the deveveloper crew of the game and as you delete the them, you also delete the game which is the end goal.
                    <br><br>
                    The game was built with Unreal together with a team of 9 and 2 external music students assigned by FutureGames.

            <h1 class="game-sub-title">Introduction</h1> <!-- Introduction -->
            <p>
                Our first project without traditional leads, artists, QA's, and UX presented a unique challenge. However, we were fortunate to collaborate with two external 
                music students, which added a fresh perspective. We also experimented with two game prototypes, which were later voted on and selected. In the absence of 
                an art team, I took on the responsibilities of <mark>animation</mark> and <mark>gameplay</mark> development. Our team utilized <mark>Perforce</mark> for source control, <mark>Miro</mark> for prototyping, 
                and <mark>Jira</mark> for project management.
            </p>
            <h1 class="game-sub-title">Gameplay</h1> <!-- Gameplay -->
            <p>
                Our initial prototype utilized <mark>artificial intelligence</mark>, which I worked on during our AI course. Although the project was ultimately scrapped, I gained valuable 
                experience with key concepts like <mark>behaviour trees</mark>, <mark>search spaces</mark>, and <mark>graph theory</mark>, all of which I applied to the project.
                <br><br>
                When a crew member is deleted, the crew list widget is dynamically updated to remove their associated work. Previously, a separate function was created 
                for each crew member by one of our designers, but I refactored the code to use a single, reusable function. Additionally, I modified the third-person blueprint 
                to a first-person controller, allowing us to leverage Unreal Engine's built-in gun functionality.
            </p>
            <h1 class="game-sub-title">Animation</h1> <!-- Animation -->
            <p>
                Our team opted to utilize online animation packs, as none of us had experience with animation. Personally, I relied on 
                <a href="https://www.mixamo.com/#/" target="_blank">mixamo <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a>, a trusted animation
                platform, to bring our project to life.
            </p>
            <h1 class="game-sub-title">What I learned</h1> <!-- What I Learned -->
            <p>
                I learned that seeking feedback from others is crucial, as what may seem complete to me may not be perceived the 
                same way by others. Additionally, I acquired a significant amount of knowledge about Unreal Engine.
