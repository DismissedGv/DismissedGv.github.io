                <p>
                    Biochem Nightshift is a horror and puzzle game where you play as a process operator, needing to navigate through the dangerous corridors of Ulrich's 
                    Medical Science and solve puzzles.
                    <br><br>
                    The game was built with Unreal together with a team of 16 people assigned by FutureGames.

            <h1 class="game-sub-title">Introduction</h1> <!-- Introduction -->
            <p>
                In this project, I took on the role of <mark>gameplay</mark>, <mark>source control manager</mark>, and <mark>product owner</mark>, a unique responsibility that only one other programmer 
                had undertaken at FutureGames before me. I had been eager to try this out, especially after our mentor encouraged us to leaving our "comfort zone".
                Our team utilized <mark>Perforce</mark> as source control, <mark>Miro</mark> for prototyping, <mark>Jira</mark> for project management.
            </p>
            <h1 class="game-sub-title">Product Owner</h1> <!-- Product Owner -->
            <p>
                As a first-time <mark>product owner</mark>, I gained invaluable insights into the importance of <mark>leadership</mark> and effective <mark>communication</mark>. 
                Despite the challenges we faced as a team, including absences and communication breakdowns, I learned to continuously emphasize the need for 
                clear dialogue. Although not everyone was on the same page, my prior experience on a project proved to be a significant advantage. Here are 
                the key takeaways from my experience:
                <br><br>
                - The crucial role of communication in team success.
                <br>
                - Not expecting everyone to be on the same page when no one disagrees.
                <br>
                - Getting to know everyone on the team for a better understanding of each other and their roles.
                <br><br>
                Our team was facing difficulties during our second greenlight process. However, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to speak with a professional. 
                This conversation was particularly helpful as I had previously discussed this matter with my mentor, who provided valuable guidance and support. 
                Our team may have been the messiest, but as the saying goes, "It's through our failures that we learn and grow." and I learned a lot from this experience.
            </p>
            <h1 class="game-sub-title">Gameplay</h1> <!-- Gameplay -->
            <p>
                When it comes to <mark>gameplay</mark>, I had a lot on my plate as a product owner. Therefore I barely got to implemented anything into the game other than my 
                marble maze puzzle and a few other small mechanics.
                <br><br>
                I got the marble maze made by an artist in our team which I switched it to <mark>"complex collision"</mark> for the walls to collide with the marble and finished it up 
                with a end goal whenever the ball reaches the end which give the player a key and put <mark>"auto possession"</mark> back to the player blueprint.
            </p>
            <h1 class="game-sub-title">What I learned</h1> <!-- What I Learned -->
            <p>
                This game project was a valuable learning experience, teaching me the importance of leadership, effective communication, and prioritization. 
                As the lead on key tool like Perforce, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of clear communication and the need to set 
                realistic goals. Having worked on a project previously, I felt more confident this time around, but I still learned the value of knowing my limits 
                and saying 'no' when necessary.
